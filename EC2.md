## Type of instance

- General Purpose
- compute optimized
- Memory Optimize
- Storage OPtimize
- Accelerated Computing
- High Memory
- Previous Generation

## General Purpose Instances

> General Purpose instances provide a balance of compute memory and networking Resource, and can be used for a variety of workloads.

Genral Purpose series

- A series (medium, large)
- M series (M4, M5, M5a, M5ad, M5d, M5ad, M5d)
- T series (T2: t2-micro free tier eligible, T3, T3a)

## Memory Optimization

> Meomry optimization instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workload that process large data set in memory

## Storage Optimized Instance

> Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that Require high, Sequential Read and Write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized tens of thousands of low Latency. Random I/O Operation per second (IOPS) to application
